# Your Annoying Neighbor's Calendar

This is my Event Center website project. It's a multi-page website about tracking annoying neighbor events.

Just open `index.html` in your web browser. You can double-click it or right-click and choose "Open with" and pick your browser.

All the pages are linked together in the navigation menu at the top.

## What's Included

- Back to top button

## Notes

The contact form doesn't actually submit anywhere yet - it just has the HTML structure. All the images are from online sources.
